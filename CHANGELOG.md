# Changelog

## v2.4.12

### Added or Changed
- Changed active link color on 'contact.html' from 'about' to 'contact'

### Removed

### Bugs
- Background image for certain sections are not attached in a fixed position on mobile devices, this is a known issue for mobile devices and will be addressed when a solution is tested and found. Temporarily, all 'bg-fixed' images have been given the prefix of 'lg:' so they only display on large screens and so that the background images look normal on mobile devices.
