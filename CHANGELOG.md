# Changelog

## v2.10.53

### Added, Changed, or Fixed
- Changed the file size of LCPs to reduce load times

### Removed

### Bugs
- Background image for certain sections are not attached in a fixed position on mobile devices, this is a known issue for mobile devices and will be addressed when a solution is tested and found. Temporarily, all 'bg-fixed' images have been given the prefix of 'lg:' so they only display on large screens and so that the background images look normal on mobile devices.
