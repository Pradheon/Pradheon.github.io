# Changelog

## v2.8.27

### Added, Changed, or Fixed
- Fixed an issue where images weren't loading in the footer due to incorrect file path

### Removed


### Bugs
- Background image for certain sections are not attached in a fixed position on mobile devices, this is a known issue for mobile devices and will be addressed when a solution is tested and found. Temporarily, all 'bg-fixed' images have been given the prefix of 'lg:' so they only display on large screens and so that the background images look normal on mobile devices.
