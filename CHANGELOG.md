# Changelog

## v2.4.17

### Added or Changed
- Change 'h-dvh' value in hero section to 'h-svh' value for mobile

### Removed


### Bugs
- Background image for certain sections are not attached in a fixed position on mobile devices, this is a known issue for mobile devices and will be addressed when a solution is tested and found. Temporarily, all 'bg-fixed' images have been given the prefix of 'lg:' so they only display on large screens and so that the background images look normal on mobile devices.
